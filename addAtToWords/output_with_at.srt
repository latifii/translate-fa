1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:01,920
So now that we covered

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,650
some crucial TypeScript essentials,

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,403
let's get started with connecting TypeScript to @React.@

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,400
And for that, in this section

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,000
we're going to build a basic demo project,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,220
which allows you to set and manage

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,040
the goals you have for this course.

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,400
And it's this demo project that will allow us

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,630
to dive into all those essential, crucial concepts

10
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,750
you must know no matter which @React@ app

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,330
you're building with TypeScript.

12
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,960
And therefore, in this section we'll explore

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,820
how to work with components and @props@ and TypeScript.

14
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,610
We'll take a look at how we can handle events

15
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,130
when using @React@ with TypeScript,

16
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,530
and of course, very important

17
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,410
also how we can deal with @state.@

18
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,940
Last but not least,

19
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,090
we'll also explore how we can get user input

20
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,880
with help of @forms@ and @refs.@

21
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,370
And therefore, by the end of this section

22
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,570
you'll have a solid @React@ and TypeScript foundation

23
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,240
and you'll be ready to dive into more advanced

24
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,003
@React@ and TypeScript features thereafter.
