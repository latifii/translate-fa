1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:02,910
So to update this state here

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:04,320
in handleAddGoal,

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,490
I'll use this function form for updating my state

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,100
because the state will be updated

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,520
based on the previous state snapshot.

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,870
And as you also learn

7
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,630
in my "React - The Complete Guide" course,

8
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,750
if your new state depends on the old state,

9
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,600
you should use this special function form

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,700
for updating the state.
